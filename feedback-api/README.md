# H2O.ai Assignment for a feedback system

### Asumptions
*   Only logged in users can give feedback, therefore a feedback contains the logged in user id.
*   It is assumed that the user is already logged in and no validation is performed on that.
*   User gives the feedback for a product which is already stored in the db, therefore feedback contains only the product id.
*   Rating is mandatory, but not the description (comment).
